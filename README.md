# For you to do

Write a unit test for the GET /authors service. 
The service should respond with a list of author names and lifetimes sorted by family name of the authors. It should respond
with a "No authors found" message when there are no authors in the database. If an error occurs when retrieving the authors then the
service responds with an error code of 500. The unit test
should be placed in `tests/authorService.test.ts`.
